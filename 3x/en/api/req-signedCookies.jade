  h3(id='req.signedCookies') req.signedCookies

  p.
    This object requires the <code>cookieParser(secret)</code> middleware for use. 
    It contains signed cookies sent by the user-agent, unsigned and ready for use. 
    Signed cookies reside in a different object to show developer intent; otherwise, 
    a malicious attack could be placed on `req.cookie` values (which are easy to spoof). 
    Note that signing a cookie does not make it "hidden" or encrypted; this simply 
    prevents tampering (because the secret used to sign is private). If no signed 
    cookies are sent, it defaults to <code>{}</code>.

    req.signedCookies.user
    // => "tobi"
