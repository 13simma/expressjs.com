# Debugging Express

Express uses the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) module
internally to log information about route matches and application mode.
To see this information, simply set the `DEBUG` environment variable to
`express:*` when launching your app and the debug information will
appear on the console.

```
$ DEBUG=express:* node ./bin/www
```

Running this on the `hello world` example would print the following

```
express:application booting in development mode +0ms
express:router defined get /hello.txt +0ms
express:router defined get /hello.txt +1ms
```

Additionally, the app generated by the express executable (generator) also uses the `debug` module and by default is scoped to the `my-application` debug namespace.

You can enable those debug statements with the following command

```
$ DEBUG=my-application node ./bin/www
```

For more documentation on `debug`, see the [debug guide](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug).
