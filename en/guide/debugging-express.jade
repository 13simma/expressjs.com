  p.
    Express uses the <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/debug">debug</a> module
    internally to log information about route matches and application mode.
    To see this information, simply set the <code>DEBUG</code> environment variable to
    <code>express:*</code> when launching your app and the debug information will
    appear on the console.

  +shell.
    $ DEBUG=express:* node ./bin/www

  p.
    Running this on the <code>hello world</code> example would print the following

  +shell.
    express:application booting in development mode +0ms
    express:router defined get /hello.txt +0ms
    express:router defined get /hello.txt +1ms

  p.
    Additionally, the app generated by the express executable (generator) also uses the <code>debug</code> module and by default is scoped to the <code>my-application</code> debug namespace.

  p.
    You can enable those debug statements with the following command

  +shell.
    $ DEBUG=my-application node ./bin/www
