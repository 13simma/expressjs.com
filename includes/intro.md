    Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides
    a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

    With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your
    disposal, creating a robust user-friendly API is quick and easy.

    Express provides a thin layer of features fundamental
    to any web application, without obscuring features
    that you know and love in Node.js.
